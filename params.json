{"name":"Pworkdir","tagline":"Allocation of workdir for competing processes","body":"\r\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/guillon/pworkdir.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guillon/pworkdir/branches)\r\n\r\n# Synopsis\r\n\r\npworkdir is a tools which can be used for allocating a set of working\r\ndirectories given some constraints.\r\n\r\nIn particular the main motivation for pworkdir is to ensure that sufficient\r\ndisk space is available for several processes competing for some disk\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nFor instance, let's say that a job, executable through a script `job.sh`,\r\nrequires 10Gbytes of work space to execute and one wants to launch 5 of these\r\njobs on the current directory. A simple way to ensure that jobs are scheduled\r\nsuch that sufficient space is available for each of them in isolation is to\r\ndo:\r\n\r\n    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &\r\n    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &\r\n    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &\r\n    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &\r\n    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &\r\n    $ wait\r\n\r\nAssuming for instance that only 40Gbytes of disk is available on the current\r\ndir, the fifth job will wait for one of the first four to complete.\r\n\r\nThe output should look like:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    INFO: pworkdir: blocked, waiting for a free workdir since 11 secs\r\n    (timeout=0): workdirs space limit reached (used=40G, requested=10G,\r\n    available=40G, basedir=.)\r\n    ...\r\n    [1]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh\r\n    [2]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh\r\n    [3]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh\r\n    [4]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh\r\n    ... once one of the first four has finished, the fifth can start\r\n    ...\r\n    [5]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n\r\nDownload the pworkdir tool from the releases page:\r\nhttps://github.com/guillon/pworkdir/releases\r\n\r\nOr download the last stable version of the script from there:\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/pworkdir/master/pworkdir\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n    $ wget -O ~/bin/pworkdir https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/pworkdir/master/pworkdir\r\n    $ chmod +x ~/bin/pworkdir\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\nRefer to the project home page at:\r\nhttp://guillon.github.com/pworkdir\r\n\r\nFill issues and enhancement request at:\r\nhttps://github.com/guillon/pworkdir/issues\r\n\r\nRefer to the current build and validation status at:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/guillon/pworkdir?branches\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThe tool is distributed under the GPLv2 license.\r\n\r\nRefer to the COPYING file: https://github.com/guillon/pworkdir/blob/master/COPYING\r\n\r\nRefer to the COPYRIGHT file: https://github.com/guillon/pworkdir/blob/master/COPYRIGHT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
