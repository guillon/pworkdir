# Synopsis

pworkdir is a tools which can be used for allocating a set of working
directories given some constraints.

In particular the main motivation for pworkdir is to ensure that sufficient
disk space is available for several processes competing for some disk
location.

# Example

For instance, let's say that a job, executable through a script `job.sh`,
requires 10Gbytes of work space to execute and one wants to launch 5 of these
jobs on the current directory. A simple way to ensure that jobs are scheduled
such that sufficient space is available for each of them in isolation is to
do:

    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &
    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &
    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &
    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &
    $ pworkdir --space 10G exec ./job.sh &
    $ wait

Assuming for instance that only 40Gbytes of disk is available on the current
dir, the fifth job will wait for one of the first four to complete.

The output should look like:

    ...
    INFO: pworkdir: blocked, waiting for a free workdir since 11 secs
    (timeout=0): workdirs space limit reached (used=40G, requested=10G,
    available=40G, basedir=.)
    ...
    [1]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh
    [2]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh
    [3]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh
    [4]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh
    ... once one of the first four has finished, the fifth can start
    ...
    [5]   Done                  ./pworkdir --space 10G ./job.sh
    ...
